<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>A Wild Ride</h1><br/><a href=""><img src="images/3-1.png" alt="images/3-1.png" /></a><br /><br />First step was to download the gpx.zip file<br /><br />I attempted to unzip the gpx.zip file but found that it was protected with a password.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""><img src="images/3-2.png" alt="images/3-2.png" /></a><br /><br />The next step was to crack the password with zip2john and then feed that to John the Ripper<br />to get the password to unzip the file.<br /><br /><a href=""><img src="images/3-3.png" alt="images/3-3.png" /></a><br /><a href=""><img src="images/3-4.png" alt="images/3-4.png" /></a><br /><br />The outfile of zip2john “zipped.txt” is a hash file that john can use with a wordlist like rockyou.txt<br />Let&#39;s feed john<br /><br /><a href=""><img src="images/3-5.png" alt="images/3-5.png" /></a><br /><br />Now we have the password to unzip the gpx.zip file.<br /><a href=""><img src="images/3-6.png" alt="images/3-6.png" /></a><br /><br />The zip file contains 252 individual ride_XXX.gpx files. What in the world is a .gpx file?<br />I googled “What is a .gpx file” and clicked on the first link that was fileinfo.com :<br /><a href=""><img src="images/3-7.png" alt="images/3-7.png" /></a><br /><br />So .gpx files are geolocation tracking data that people use to display the <br />routes they take for running, biking, or general travel, which we can upload to <br />Google Maps and it will draw our routes.  Let&#39;s head to Google Maps to upload <br />our 252 .gpx files and draw our route.  Instructions from fileinfo.com:<br /><br /><a href=""><img src="images/3-8.png" alt="images/3-8.png" /></a><br /><br />When I tried importing all of the files, it seemed to accept them, but would only render one <br />route per map layer. After attempting to add multiple layers, with one .gpx file per layer, I <br />realized that not only do I not have time to do all this, Google caps the number of layers you <br />add to a single map (9 if I remember correctly).<br /><a href=""><img src="images/3-9.png" alt="images/3-9.png" /></a><br /><br />The data files are all the same in that they only relay lat/lon position as a string. There should <br />be a way to combine all of the tracking positions into a single file.  I Googled &quot;combine gtx files<br />into one&quot; and found the link <a href="https://gotoes.org/strava/Combine_GPX_TCX_FIT_Files.php">https://gotoes.org/strava/Combine_GPX_TCX_FIT_Files.php</a> which is a <br />webapp that will take your .gpx files and combine them into one file.<br /><a href=""><img src="images/3-10.png" alt="images/3-10.png" /></a><br /><br />I threw all my gpx files into the uploader and got an error message that it would only take 20 gpx files at a time.  <br />I was not excited to have to do this multiple times.  But at the bottom of the interface it says that if your files are too large<br />for the uploader, you can zip them.  Okay. I created a new password free zip file of just the .gpx files to upload.<br /><a href=""><img src="images/3-11.png" alt="images/3-11.png" /></a><br />The uploader accepted the newzip.zip file and I clicked on the ‘next steps’ button that appeared.<br /><a href=""><img src="images/3-12.png" alt="images/3-12.png" /></a><br />I kept all the default parameters and scrolled to the bottom of the screen and clicked:<br /><a href=""><img src="images/3-13.png" alt="images/3-13.png" /></a><br /><br />When this menu popped up I chose to save the file<br /><a href=""><img src="images/3-14.png" alt="images/3-14.png" /></a><br /><br />Once this file downloaded, I went back to Google Maps and imported my new <br />combined .gpx file and added it to the map:<br /><a href=""><img src="images/3-15.png" alt="images/3-15.png" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
